# ATMmachineApp
We know that we use banknotes in circulation in denominations of
1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000

The user enters any amount (which the ATM will have to give him), as well as a comma-separated list of denominations of banknotes that are in the ATM (the amount is not needed).

As a result, the program should give out how many bills of what denomination you need to get the specified amount.

Example of calculations:
5669 sum, denominations are 1, 2, 100; the result will be that 100 - 56, 2 - 34, 1 - 1
